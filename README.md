# OS-CA
A question on deadlock was given and the solution for it has also been made using C programming.
Q.Reena's operating system uses an algorithm for deadlock avoidance to manage the allocation of resources say three namely A,B and C to three processes say P0,P1 and P2.Consider the following sequence as reference,user must enter the current state of system as given in this example:
suppose P0 has 0,0,1 instances,P1 is having 3,2,0 instances and P2 occupies 2,1,1 instances of A,B,C resourse respectively .
Also the maximum number of resources required for P0 is 8,4,3 and for P1 is 6,2,0 and finally for P2 there are 3,3,3 instances of A,B,C respectively.There are 3 instance of resource A 2 instances of resource B and 2 instances of resource C available.Write a program to check whether Reenas operating system is in a safe state or not.
